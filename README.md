# Analysis of the 5 Stages of Cosmic Expansion

### Five Phases of Cosmic Expansion: Accelerated and Decelerated Expansion, Accelerated and Decelerated Contraction, and Equilibrium Oscillation

Before the Big Bang, the universe existed in a highly compressed state, known as the Pre-Big Bang Initial State (Stage 0) . In this state, the universe’s SEQ (Spacetime Energy Quantum) network was tightly packed, with resonant frequencies nearly at zero. This low-entropy condition was characterized by a few SEQ possessing high energy, while the majority had very low energy, forming a High-energy Aggregation State.

In Stage 1, the universe entered a phase where compression potential energy was converted into kinetic energy. This marked the beginning of cosmic expansion. As the elastic compression potential energy was released, it transformed into the kinetic energy driving the universe’s rapid expansion. During this stage, the universe experienced accelerating expansion, maintaining a relatively low entropy state, yet with a high concentration of energy and a rapid increase in entropy.

As the expansion continued, the system transitioned into Stage 2, where kinetic energy began to transform into tension potential energy. This shift caused the rate of expansion to slow down, leading to a decelerating expansion phase. Throughout this stage, the entropy of the universe steadily increased, reflecting the ongoing dispersal of energy.

In Stage 3, the stored tension potential energy started to be released and converted back into kinetic energy, initiating a phase of accelerating contraction. This stage marked a reversal of the expansion process, with the universe beginning to collapse inward. Despite the change in direction, the entropy of the system continued to rise.

In Stage 4, the contraction process transformed kinetic energy into compression potential energy, leading to a decelerating contraction phase. As the universe approached a more compact state, energy distribution became increasingly uniform, with no dominant concentrated regions remaining. 

In Stage 5， The system moved closer to a state of thermal equilibrium, where entropy approached its maximum value, and the universe began to exhibit equilibrium oscillations.

### NOTE:
1	Potential energy is stored in elastic bonds composed of sub-Planck scale components.  

2	In this model the energy of SEQ mᵢ equals the SEQ resonant kinetic energy plus the SEQ spin rotational kinetic energy plus the elastic potential energy assigned to this SEQ from its adjacent elastic bonds manifested as frequency suppression.

3	Chapter 10 will discuss that mass formation is mainly due to spin locking the spatial compression state and the key factor is the coupling confinement potential between the spinor and the SEQ fixed chirality spin.
